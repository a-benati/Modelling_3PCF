Set of files regarding the modelling of the 3-point correlation function (3PCF)
which extend the current CosmoBolognaLib libraries (https://github.com/federicomarulli/CosmoBolognaLib.git).
The header files (.h) should be saved at *CosmoBolognaLib/Headers/*, the file 3PCF.cpp
should be saved at *CosmoBolognaLib/Cosmology/Lib/* and the files *ModelFunction*.cpp* and
*Modelling*.cpp* should be saved at *CosmoBolognaLib/Modelling/ThreePointCorrelation/*.
